title: "MAPS: Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies — A computational framework to align human and model explanations"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/maps
excerpt: "MAPS is a validated tool that identifies which ANN explanations best match human vision. By converting attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs), it links model explanations with human and macaque behavior and enables principled comparison of interpretability methods using far fewer trials."
