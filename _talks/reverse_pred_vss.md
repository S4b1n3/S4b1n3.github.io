How should we evaluate whether an artificial neural network truly represents objects the way the primate visual system does? In this talk, I introduce Reverse Predictivity, a complementary metric that tests how well population activity in macaque IT can predict the internal (IT-like) units of models. Using large-scale time-resolved IT recordings and features from diverse ANN architectures, I show that reverse predictivity reveals alignment patterns that traditional encoding analyses (i.e., forward predictivity) miss. Combined, forward and reverse predictivity provide a more complete picture of model–brain similarity, exposing representational differences that are invisible when using only a one-directional evaluation.
