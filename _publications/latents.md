collection: publications
category: ai_conferences
permalink: /publication/latents
excerpt: 'We systematically investigate how different inductive biases shape the latent space of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in one-shot drawing tasks, comparing standard LDM regularizers with supervised and contrastive objectives. We find that redundancy-reduction and prototype-based regularizations enable LDMs to generate near-human-like drawings (highly recognizable and original), bringing machine one-shot generation remarkably close to human performance.'
