title: "Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony"
collection: publications
category: ai_conferences
permalink: /publication/tracking
excerpt: 'We introduce a complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN) that leverages neural synchrony to bind the different features of target objects while they change locations, offering a biologically inspired mechanism for tracking appearance-morphing objects. Using FeatureTracker, a large-scale challenge involving controlled changes in object shape, color, and location, we show that while standard deep networks fail, the CV-RNN closely matches human performance, providing a computational proof-of-concept for synchrony-based object tracking.'
