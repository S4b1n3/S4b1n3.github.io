title: "Distinct contributions of memorability and object recognition to the representational goals of the macaque inferior temporal cortex"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/memorability
excerpt: "We show that incorporating image memorability as an additional training objective—in addition to object recognition—substantially improves ANN alignment with primate inferior temporal (IT) cortex. Models jointly optimized for recognition and memorability capture non-overlapping neural variance, reduce non–brain-like units, and better match human memorability patterns, revealing that IT supports multiple representational goals beyond recognition alone."

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
