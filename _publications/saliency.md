title: "Saliency strikes back: How filtering out high frequencies improves white-box explanations"
collection: publications
category: ai_conferences
permalink: /publication/saliency
excerpt: 'We identify a major limitation of gradient-based white-box attribution methods (their susceptibility to high-frequency artifacts) and introduce FORGrad, a simple filtering approach that removes these distortions using architecture-specific optimal cut-off frequencies. Across models, FORGrad reliably boosts the performance of existing white-box methods, allowing them to rival more accurate but computationally expensive black-box approaches and enabling more faithful and efficient explainability.'
