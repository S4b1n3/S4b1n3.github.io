title: "GASPnet: Global Agreement to Synchronize Phases"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/gaspnet
excerpt: 'We introduce a new, neuroscience-inspired binding mechanism that integrates Transformer-style attention with phase-based synchrony, enabling neural networks to selectively enhance interactions between neurons with aligned temporal phases while suppressing mismatched signals. By incorporating Kuramoto-driven phase alignment into all layers of a convolutional network, our model achieves higher accuracy, stronger noise robustness, and better generalization than standard CNNs on multi-object datasets, offering a principled solution to the visual binding problem in artificial networks.'
