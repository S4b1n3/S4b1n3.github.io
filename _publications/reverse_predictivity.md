collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/reverse_predictivity
excerpt: 'We introduce reverse predictivity, a new metric that complements traditional forward predictivity by testing bidirectional alignment (how well ANN representations can be predicted by macaque IT activity). While monkey-to-monkey and same-architecture ANN initializations show symmetry, ANNs exhibit a striking asymmetry with IT, and we identify factors (such as adversarial training) that reduce these non-IT-aligned representational dimensions and improve ANN–brain alignment.'
