title: "MAPS: Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies — A computational framework to align human and model explanations"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/maps
excerpt: "MAPS is a general, behaviorally validated tool that identifies which ANN-derived explanations best account for human vision across diverse visual tasks. By converting attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs), MAPS links model explanations with human and macaque behavior, providing a principled way to compare and select interpretability methods using far fewer behavioral trials."
