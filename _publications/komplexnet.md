title: "Enhancing deep neural networks through complex-valued representations and Kuramoto synchronization dynamics"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/komplexnet
excerpt: 'We investigate whether neural-inspired synchrony can improve object binding in deep learning models, testing whether complex-valued representations and Kuramoto dynamics can align phases and group features belonging to the same object. Across multi-object and noisy visual categorization tasks, including overlapping digits and out-of-distribution inputs, both feedforward and recurrent synchrony-based models outperform real-valued and unsynchronized complex networks, demonstrating that phase-based mechanisms can substantially enhance performance, robustness, and generalization.'
